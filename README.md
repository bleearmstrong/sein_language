# seinfeld_analysis

The general idea here is to analyze Seinfeld scripts for character analysis.

Scripts will be scraped from www.seinology.com, processed, and then analyzed.

Along the way, we'll build a George Costanza twitter bot that tweets random George lines (https://twitter.com/gcostanzabot).
